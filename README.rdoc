== Getting Started

Rails Version: 5.0.0

When you clone the repo there will be a file "/config/secrets.yml" missing. You will need to set up a google api and discord api credentials and then add the credentials that file.

== For Deployment
# What we need...
* Set up specific API's for google and discord to redirect to the correct url
